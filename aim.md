<!-- ### Aim of the experiment -->

To simulate the Two-Phase Commit (2PC) protocol over one coordinator and four participants - allowing controlled crashes and link failures - and to verify that, despite these faults, the system always reaches a consistent global outcome (either all commit or all abort).

<!-- , while highlighting 2PC's blocking behavior under coordinator failure -->
